  Source directory: src/docutray/

  This is an API wrapper library following patterns from stripe-python and openai-python.
  The SDK follows a 3-layer architecture: Client Layer → HTTP Layer → Exceptions Layer.

  Conventions:
  - All code, comments, and documentation must be in English
  - Internal documentation in /docs may be in Spanish
  - Use Google-style docstrings
  - Full type hints compatible with mypy strict mode
  - Private modules prefixed with underscore (_client.py, _http.py, etc.)

  Domain: Document processing API (OCR, identification, extraction, knowledge bases, workflows)

rules:
  proposal:
    - Reference the project architecture (3-layer pattern)
    - Consider both sync and async implementations
  tasks:
    - Each task should be independently testable
    - Include type hints in all code tasks
